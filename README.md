## What this project is about
This was a group project from the Codaisseur Academy. We have created a slackbot, that asks three questions about student's energy, engagament and happiness. The bot saves the information to database and frontend app displays the data of the dashboard in three line charts.

I was responsible for the data visualisation, layout and style of the front-end app.
